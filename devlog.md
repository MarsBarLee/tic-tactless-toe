2023-08-24

- 5m: Start building a non-hardcoded print_board()
- 5m: Update board with test values and retrieve test value
- 5m: Add a test to print_board() using f-strings to print variable in strings
- 5m: Move placement of quotes and double quotes in multi-line f-string in print_board()
- 5m: Reformat multi-line f-string with f in front of each line and \n at end

- 5m: Test out interactive session with 'python3 -i tic-tactless-toe.py' and exit()
- 5m: Test out interactive session with update_board() and print_board()

2023-08-25
- 15m: Talk to Patrick on feedback such has persistent board after exit(), use while loop to consistently ask for next player's move by checking for check_win() and making final version of functions modular

2023-08-28
- Goal: Make functions like update_board() and print_board() modular
- 5m: Add check_valid_move()
- 5m: Add statement to check range of player's values in check_valid_move()
- 5m: Add else statemnet to check_valid_move()
- 5m: Add switch_player_turn()
- 5m: Split start() into start_game() and start_turn()
- 5m: Add check_win()
- 5m: Add diagonal (left-to-right) and horizontal (top row) win conditions to check_win()
- 5m: Add horizontal (middle row), horizontal (bottom row) and vertical win (left column) to check_win()
- 5m: Add vertical (left, right, middle columns) and diagonal (right-to-left) to check_win()
- 5m: Add check_draw()
- 5m: Add restart()
- Thought: Might need to start branching soon since I've laid down most of the most logic and will need to majorly re-arrange things soon eg making functions modular and replacing test values with final values
- 5m: Change quit() into quit_game() to not trigger built-in Python command quit()
- Next-up: Add quote repository as Python class with 'Game states' as key-value pairs, add translation table

2023-08-29
- 5m: Add class for quote_repository
- 5m: Add win_game, draw, restart and quit for quote_repository
- 5m: Add invalid_move, ask_player_for_move adn start_game for quote_repository
- 5m: Add global variable game_status and create an object instance of quote_repository class\
- Next-up: Add 'Game states' to functions, add translation table

2023-08-31
- 5m: Add game_state to various functions
- 5m: Add more game_state to various functions
- Next-up: Test out interactive session with update_board() and print_board() still works
- 10m: Debug errors from interactive session and update error_log.md
- 5m: Debug error ""(" was not closed" in check_win()'
- 5m: Create and switch to debug_check_win() branch

2023-09-01
- 5m: Remove error by replacing if statement with placeholder values
- 5m: Add back OR statement and debug bracket and : errors
- 5m: Run check_win() without errors
- 5m: Use placeholder in starting board to trigger a check_win() condition
- 5m: Read about comparing one variable with multiple possible values at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15112125/how-to-test-multiple-variables-for-equality-against-a-single-value
- Thought: Maybe in future branch, re-implment check_win() with a containment test against a set, eg if 'X' in {board[0][0], board[0][1], board[0][2]}:
- 5m: Re-add and upate rest of win conditions to correct syntax to check_win and run without errors
